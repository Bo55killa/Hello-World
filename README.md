# Hello-World
This is my first repository and it may be deleted along the line but for now, it will contain some basic game design ideas i have come up with.
Right now I'm studying game design and production management at Abertay university in Dundee.
I joined the games development society and we have the oppurtunity to work in small teams and produce a game, the only bad thing is we have 8 weeks to do so
